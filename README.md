## Artificial Intelligence
Artificial intelligence leverages computers and machines to mimic the problem-solving and decision-making capabilities of the human mind.
Artificial intelligence is the simulation of human intelligence processes by machines, especially computer systems. 
Specific applications of AI include expert systems, natural language processing, speech recognition and machine vision etc.

## IoT
The Internet of Things describes physical objects, that are embedded with sensors, processing ability, software, and other technologies, and that connect and exchange data with other devices and systems over the Internet or other communications networks.

## Big Data 
What exactly is big data?

The definition of big data is data that contains greater variety, arriving in increasing volumes and with more velocity. This is also known as the three Vs.
Put simply, big data is larger, more complex data sets, especially from new data sources. These data sets are so voluminous that traditional data processing software just can’t manage them. But these massive volumes of data can be used to address business problems you wouldn’t have been able to tackle before.

Big data analytics is the use of advanced analytic techniques against very large, diverse data sets that include structured, semi-structured and unstructured data, from different sources, and in different sizes from terabytes to zettabytes.

## Cloud Computing
Cloud computing transforms IT infrastructure into a utility: It lets you ‘plug into' infrastructure via the internet, and use computing resources without installing and maintaining them on-premises.

## Blockchain Technology
Blockchain is a system of recording information in a way that makes it difficult or impossible to change, hack, or cheat the system. A blockchain is essentially a digital ledger of transactions that is duplicated and distributed across the entire network of computer systems on the blockchain.

## Cryptocurrency and DeFi
A cryptocurrency, crypto-currency, or crypto is a binary data designed to work as a medium of exchange wherein individual coin ownership records are stored in a ledger existing in a form of a computerized database using strong cryptography to secure transaction records, to control the creation of additional coins, and to verify the transfer of coin ownership
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency

Decentralised DeFi protocols are built on the foundation of Ethereum cryptocurrency. Decentralised Finance (DeFi) is a system that allows financial products to appear on a public blockchain network which is not regulated by a central bank or intermediary.

## Human Computer Interaction
Human-computer interaction deals with the construction and implementation of interfaces and tool-building technologies that would adapt seamlessly to people's needs. 
Human-computer interaction focuses on creating simplified interfaces to achieve the best satisfaction for various types of users.

## AR/VR
Augmented reality (AR) and Virtual Reality (VR) bridge the digital and physical worlds. 

They allow you to take in information and content visually, in the same way you take in the world. 
AR dramatically expands the ways our devices can help with everyday activities like searching for information, shopping, and expressing yourself. 

VR lets you experience what it's like to go anywhere — from the front row of a concert to distant planets in outer space.

## Bioinformatics
Bioinformatics is defined as the application of tools of computation and analysis to the capture and interpretation of biological data. It is an interdisciplinary field, which harnesses computer science, mathematics, physics, and biology
It is essential for management of data in modern biology and medicine. 
It is being used to interpret biological data and to further understanding of disease. 
The potential clinical applications of these data is in drug discovery and development.

## Embedded Computer Vision
Compact vision systems (on the basis of adapted camera modules) are integrated directly into machines or devices.
Embedded vision is the integration of computer vision in machines that use algorithms to decode meaning from observing (image & video).

## Full Stack Development
A full stack developer is a person who is comfortable working in the front-end and back-end side of web development. 
A Full Stack Developer works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. 
Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well.
